<p>"Ekaterina."</p><p>Alexei came to meet Ekaterina when she was moving to the school building after the entrance ceremony.</p><p>"Brother!" Ekaterina happily ran to her brother's side. "Brother, your speech was wonderful."</p><p>"Hmm? Ah. I was a sudden stand-in, so I didn't say much."</p><p>Her guess about substituting someone else was a bingo. But even if Alexei didn't prepare for the speech, he was so calm before.</p><p>"Rather than me, aren't you more interested in the prince?"</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"His Highness Mikhail gave a speech right after me, right? What do you think about him?"</p><p>Eh? Ehhhhh?</p><p>Why did he suddenly mention the prince? Did Brother find out I was having weird thoughts during His Highness' entire speech?</p><p>"Ah… His Highness, eh. Right, uh, his speech is great…"</p><p>No good. I sounded so suspicious.</p><p>Let's be honest here. So that Brother wouldn't get angry at me.</p><p>"Um… It didn't… really leave an impression on me…"</p><p><strong><strong>Visit nove‍lpub.c​om for a better_user experience</strong></strong></p><p>"......"</p><p>Oh, a silent pause.</p><p>Maybe he was stunned. But, but, Brother was better than the prince! It couldn't be helped!</p><p>"Uh, Brother! Rather than that, can I ask you something?"</p><p>"Y-yeah, of course."</p><p>"Brother, are you engaged with anyone!?"</p><p>"...Huh?"</p><p>No, Brother. Please don't give me such a blank look.</p><p>"Um, I know that it's not something I can interfere with. But let me tell you this, Brother. No matter who is Brother's wife, I will never be mean towards her! I promise that I won't start a feud between women and trouble you!"</p><p><em>('Don't bully the in-law!' I had tattooed this slogan in my heart!)</em></p><p>Ekaterina inwardly emphasized, clenching her fist.</p><p>"Feud…" Alexei muttered, then he laughed.</p><p>...How rare. This was the first time Ekaterina saw her brother laughing out loud. He looked younger than usual, adorable.</p><p>But this was not the time for him to laugh. The in-law problem was probably a fundamental problem for women! Well, she never became a wife or mother-in-law, though.</p><p><strong><strong>This_content is taken from nove‎lpub.c‍om</strong></strong></p><p>A little farther away, Ekaterina could see the students heading to the school building were looking at Alexei in a daze.</p><p>"I-I'm not engaged," Alexei answered, removing his monocle and wiping his tears. "I'll consider it after I graduate. Since I have to focus on my job as the Duke and my studies, it's not the time for me to get engaged. Besides, I will get married only after I marry you to a proper family. So there's no need for you to worry about feuds or anything."</p><p>Ekaterina was relieved to hear that. And when her brother removed his monocle, he looked even cuter.</p><p>"I'm going to be a bride after seeing my brother's happiness with my own eyes."</p><p>"That means both of us won't be able to marry, right? Then we will always be together."</p><p>"That's nice! For me, that'll make the happiest!"</p><p><em>(Because Brother was my number one favorite!)</em></p><p>"You're such a child," Alexei said with a bitter smile, but he looked happy. "When you're a little older and have someone you like, tell me. As long as he can make you happy, I will do as you wish."</p><p>Thank you, Brother.</p><p>Actually, a part of me was eleven years older than you. I'm sorry about that.</p><p>Not to say, I was an idiot who died after playing an otome game and spent too much of my spare time to watch the scene where Brother appeared even if just a little because I liked you although you weren't the capture target. So there's a big possibility that I would stay with you forever.</p><p>I also planned never to leave your side to break the death from overworking flag from you!</p><p>After parting with Alexei, Ekaterina rushed to the freshmen's building.</p><p>She was definitely late. Almost all the students were already in the school building. She could only see a few backs of people.</p><p><strong><strong>Visit nove‍lpub.c­om for a better_reading experience</strong></strong></p><p>When Ekaterina sprinted to chase them, her eyes were pulled to the back of a girl.</p><p>She was a student with a delicate body.</p><p>Her fluffy semi-long hair was the pale pink color, resembling the cherry blossoms. Ekaterina could see that she was pretty only from her back.</p><p>The color of her eyes was bright purple like amethyst. She had round eyes and long eyelashes, the cute uniform suiting her perfectly.</p><p>The information that Ekaterina wouldn't have known just by looking at the girl's back from a distance sprung up in her head like angry waves.</p><p>But it's normal that I knew that. Because that was me.</p><p>It's also normal that the uniform suited her. Because it was designed to match that character.</p><p>Why did she walk even if I hadn't entered a command?</p><p><em>(No, it's the heroine! I'm not playing the game right now! Get ahead of yourself, me!)</em></p><p>Wait, who am I again?</p><p>My legs lost their power.</p><p><em>(Oh no, I got locked out!)</em></p><p>"Ekaterina!"</p><p>I felt like I could hear Alexei's voice from a distance.</p><p><strong><strong>Updated_at nove‌lpub.c​om</strong></strong></p><p>But before I could confirm it, I blacked out.</p>
